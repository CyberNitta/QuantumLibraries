# Proposal title

## Conceptual overview

<!-- Provide a motivation for and description of your proposal here. -->

### Current status

<!-- Contrast your proposal with the current status of the Q# standard and domain-specific libraries here. -->

### User feedback

<!-- If there is specific feedback (typically other GitHub issues) that motivate your proposal, link them here along with a brief discussion of how your proposal addresses that feedback. -->

### Child issues

<!-- This section should be a bulleted list of any issues that will be resolved by a completed implementation of your proposal. Note that this section may be redundant with the previous section; that's perfectly OK. -->

## Proposal

### New and modified functions, operations, and UDTs

<!-- This is the core of your actual proposal, and should consist of a bulleted list of changes to the Q# API surface included in your proposal, grouped by namespace. -->


### Modifications to style guide

<!-- Does your proposal require modifying the style guide or API design principles? If so, please list and discuss any required modifications here, as that carries a unique impact that requires separate discussion. -->

### Impact of breaking changes

<!-- If your proposal includes breaking changes beyond @Deprecated attributes, please list those changes here and their expected impact on Q# users. -->

## Examples

### Current status

<!-- As appropriate, list examples of using the current Q# API. -->

### Using proposed changes

<!-- As appropriate, list examples of using the changes included in your proposal. -->

## Relationship to Q# language feature proposals

<!-- If your proposal is related to existing Q# language proposals (see https://github.com/microsoft/qsharp-language), please list those proposals here along with how your proposal would change based on the outcome of those Q# language discussions. -->

## Alternatives considered

<!-- In this section, list each different alternative to your proposal as a distinct subsection, and compare the pros/cons with respect to your proposal. -->

## Open design questions and considerations

<!-- List any questions and considerations not resolved by your proposal here, so that they can be discussed and addressed during API review meetings. -->
